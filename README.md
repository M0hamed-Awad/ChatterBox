# Chatter Box ðŸ’¬ðŸ“±

Chatter Box is a chat application designed to connect users through real-time messaging. Users can create accounts, and chat with others seamlessly. This app leverages Firebase for authentication, storage, and real-time data handling, ensuring secure and efficient interactions.

## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**:
  - New users can sign up by providing an email, username, and password.
  - Users can upload a profile image directly from their device (using `image_picker`) or choose from a collection of custom avatars.
  - Profile images are uploaded and stored securely in Firebase Storage.
  - Authentication is managed via Firebase Auth, enabling secure login and account management.

- **Real-Time Messaging**:
  - Users can view a list of all registered users.
  - By selecting a user, a dedicated chat room is created where they can exchange messages in real-time.
  - Messages and chat metadata are stored in Firestore, making chat data instantly available.

- **Custom Avatars**:
  - Includes a unique collection of pre-designed avatars stored locally in the app assets.
  - Users can choose between uploading a personal image or selecting an avatar for their profile.
